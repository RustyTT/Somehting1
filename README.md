## About The Project

![Screenshot of project][screenshot]

The Connecting Dots project is a program that displays a set of 
dots with a network like animation. The program randomly generates a set of dots on the screen, each with its own position, velocity, and direction. 
As the program  runs, the dots move around the screen, bouncing 
off the edges of  the screen if they reach the boundaries and also 
collide with ther dots.

The program also calculates the distance between the dots and 
draws a line between them if they come within a certain distance 
of each other. This distance threshold can be adjusted by the user 
to create different visual effects.

The program is also customizable, allowing the user to choose the 
number of dots, their size and color, and the velocity of dots.

Overall, the Moving Dots project is an exciting opportunity to 
explore the potential of C++ and the Raylib library in creating 
visually appealing and interactive animations.

I recently took a glimpse of Object Oriented Programming in C++, and I wanted to test my understanding and write down some code to see my capabilities and yeah, here it is!
